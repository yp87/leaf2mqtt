# leaf2mqtt
> :warning: If you're not using the Leaf frequently, stop the container or drastically reduce the update frequency, or you could well end up with a flat 12V battery.

This works for my Canadian made in 2018 LEAF 40kWh. It was also reported to be working on a newer than May 2019 Leaf.

You must have a working MQTT broker on your LAN.

Should work with multiple Leafs, but it is untested. Please open an issue with feedback if possible.

## Setup
### Building the image:

    docker build -tag leaf2mqtt .

### Running the image:
| Parameter | Optional | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| LEAF_USERNAME | No | Your NissanConnect username ||
| LEAF_PASSWORD | No | Your NissanConnect password |
| LEAF_TYPE | No | newerThanMay2019, olderCanada, olderUSA, olderEurope, olderAustralia or olderJapan |
| MQTT_HOST | No | IP or hostname of your mqtt broker. Localhost or 127.0.0.1 will not work when using Docker, use real host LAN ip |
| MQTT_PORT | Yes | Port of your mqtt broker. Default is 1883  |
| MQTT_USERNAME | Yes | Your mqtt username |
| MQTT_PASSWORD | Yes | Your mqtt password |
| MQTT_BASE_TOPIC | Yes | The root MQTT topic for leaf2mqtt. Default is "leaf" |
| UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES | Yes | Time between automatic status refresh. Default is 60 |
| CHARGING_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES* | Yes | Time between automatic status refresh when charging. Default is 60 |
| COMMAND_ATTEMPTS | Yes | Number of attempts for any command regardless of success or failure. Since some of the Nissan apis are unreliable, I recommend a value of 5. Default is 1. |
| LOG_LEVEL | Yes | The log verbosity used by leaf2mqtt. Default is "Warning" |

Example:

    docker run --restart always -e LEAF_USERNAME="myusername@somewhere.com" -e LEAF_PASSWORD="Some P4ssword!" -e LEAF_TYPE="newerThanMay2019" -e MQTT_HOST=192.168.1.111 -e UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1440 -e COMMAND_ATTEMPTS=5 --name leaf2mqtt leaf2mqtt

:information_source:* The `CHARGING_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` value will only be used after the ongoing `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` is elapsed and the Leaf is charging.

## Home Assistant Integration
### Sensor examples
    sensors:
      - platform: mqtt
        name: leaf_battery_level
        # Since VIN is not specified, it will represent the state from the first vehicle in the account.
        state_topic: "leaf/battery/percentage"
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        device_class: battery

      - platform: mqtt
        name: leaf_battery_last_updated
        # Since VIN is not specified, it will represent the state from the first Leaf in the account.
        state_topic: "leaf/battery/lastUpdatedDateTimeUtc"
        device_class: timestamp

      - platform: mqtt
        name: leaf_battery_last_received
        # You can specify the vin if you prefer or if you have more than one Leaf.
        state_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/battery/lastReceivedDateTimeUtc"
        device_class: timestamp

### Recommended Battery Status Update Script
In Home Assistant, calling a script like this `- service: script.some_script_name` within another script or automation will actually stop the execution of the calling script until `script.some_script_name` terminates, unlike using `script.turn_on`. Knowing this, you can ensure you have the latest state for your leaf before continuing an automation using a script like this:

    update_leaf_battery:
      # Using queued will ensure you do not update twice at the same time and will prevent
      # subsequent invocations from asking an update right away because of the while's conditions.
      # All the callers will also wait for the result.
      mode: queued
      sequence:
        - repeat:
            while:
              # Used with the sensors in the section above, this condition will
              # ensure we continue until the states are really updated.
              # It will also prevent subsequent calls from unnecessarily requesting
              # an update before the current state is 10 minutes old.
              - >
                {{ as_timestamp(now()) -
                  as_timestamp(states('sensor.leaf_battery_last_updated')) > 600 }}

              # We also stop the loop after 4 tries since Nissan servers can send the same
              # old data many times in a row. I think this happens when the state did not really changed
              # or the Leaf is unreachable. 
              - "{{ repeat.index <= 4 }}"

            sequence:
              # We publish the update command for the car. 
              # You can also ommit the VIN to target the first Leaf in the account.
              # You can also request update for every state for one Leaf by removing the /battery section
              - service: mqtt.publish
                data:
                  topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/command/battery"
                  payload: "update"
              # We now wait until we actually have received a response or if we timed out.
              # This does not mean that the received data is the latest. This is why
              # we check sensor.leaf_battery_last_updated in the while condition.
              - wait_for_trigger:
                  - platform: state
                    entity_id: sensor.leaf_battery_last_received
                timeout: 600
        # Let's have a cool down to give time to Home Assistant to update all the states.
        - delay: "00:00:10"
